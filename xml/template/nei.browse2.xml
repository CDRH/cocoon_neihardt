            The Letters
        </h3>



        <p><img src="../files/figures/illustrations/large/JGN.BROWSEImage2.penpaper.jpg" class="left"></img>This archive contains the correspondence of John G. Neihardt (1881-1973) divided into two important categories: Collected Professional and Literary Letters and Personal and Family Correspondence.</p>

        <p>
            Among the outgoing correspondence originally collected by his biographer, Lucile Aly, we find letters that Neihardt wrote to the literary editors of various journals and presses, and the editors of newspapers he worked for (e.g. the <em>Minneapolis Journal</em>, <em>Kansas City Journal Post</em>, Joseph Pulitzer at the    <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>), as well as to other writers, such as George Sterling, Upton Sinclair and Mari Sandoz. Through his letters to close confidantes and friends, including Nicholas and Ben Black Elk, we can trace the evolution of his various essays and short stories and his longer works, <em>Black Elk Speaks</em> and <em>A Cycle of the West</em>.</p>

<p>We can also observe the trajectory of Neihardt’s growing literary and intellectual reputation through his letters to public figures such as then-Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and President Harry S. Truman and through the numerous honors and awards he received from state and regional organizations and national literary societies (as well as his “row” with <em>Poetry Magazine</em> and his near-misses with the Pulitzer). Many letters provide information and insights into his joyfully chaotic family life, including their many moves from Bancroft to Minneapolis, to Branson, St. Louis and beyond. Others offer details of Neihardt’s extensive and adventurous research-trips down the Missouri River and along the central portion of the Oregon Trail. His “outgoing” letters were sent as close to home as the Black Hills in South Dakota and as far away as New Delhi, India.

            The incoming letters held at the Neihardt Center are equally diverse, dating from the fall of 1900 to late 1973. They include correspondence with writers, critics and thinkers of national stature, such as Jessie B. Rittenhouse, H. L. Mencken, Louis Untermeyer, Sinclair, Pulitzer, Carl Sandberg, Carl Van Doren, and J. E. Boodin, as well as a number of writers with close Nebraska ties, e.g. Mildred Bennett, Nellie Yost, Marion Marsh Brown and Sandoz.

        <h3>
            Essays and Reviews
        </h3>
        <p><img src="../files/figures/illustrations/large/JGN.BROWSEImage1Study.jpg" class="center"></img>This archive contains examples of the myriad essays and reviews that Neihardt wrote over his long career as a literary book review editor, cultural critic and social observer. Through the “short forms” of the essay and review, Neihardt directly and seriously engaged an amazing array of cultural, historical, social, political, philosophical, aesthetic, spiritual and scientific ideas and debates. Regularly reading and reviewing at the rate of one book per day (occasionally more!), he took on subjects that ranged from ancient civilizations to atomic theory and emergent astrophysics (Einstein, Eddington, Jeans), human nature and psychology (Freud, behaviorism) to evolutionary theories and social Darwinism (Darwin, Wallace, Spencer, Malthus), as well as new technological developments and possibilities (from telegraphs to rocketry).

            Collectively, these materials provide new interpretative frameworks and insights into the sophistication and scope of Neihardt’s intellectual interests, aesthetic philosophy, literary work, professional and personal relationships and life itself, the medium in which he most sought to create a grand  synthesis of thought and action, the ideal and the real.
        </p>
        <p>
            By making readily available as many examples of Neihardt’s correspondence, critical essays and reviews as possible, we hope that this archive will provide fresh content and new contexts for past and current scholarly analyses of Neihardt’s life and work. Through these materials, both new readers and those long-devoted to Neihardt’s creative literary works should discover much information previously unknown to them and many surprising interconnections that will enrich their understanding of his many “voices and visions.”
        </p>
        <p>
            As these collections of letters and essays clearly evidence, whether reading and writing in small-town Nebraska or Missouri, the burgeoning cities of Minneapolis or St. Louis, Neihardt traveled far afield, physically, intellectually and philosophically.
